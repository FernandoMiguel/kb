How to Use Touch ID for sudo Authentication in Mac OS
Back up your Mac before beginning. From the Terminal (of course), you’ll want to edit /etc/pam.d/sudo by adding a new line to it. For our purposes here we’ll use nano but you’re free to use vim or emacs, or even a GUI app if you’re so inclined.

Open Terminal app if you haven’t done so already, then enter the following command:
`sudo nano </etc/pam.d/sudo>`

Hit Return and then add the following line to the top:
`auth sufficient pam_tid.so`


sudo gsed -i '2 i auth sufficient pam_tid.so' /etc/pam.d/sudo
